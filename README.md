ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Jahirul Alam Bhuyan, from Bangladesh 

I am currently a final year student of Asia Pacific University, Kuala Lumpur. My studies are on BSc. (Hons) in Computer Science. I've completed my O-Level and A-Level from India. 
I pursued a degree in Computer Science because I love coding, developing applications and things related to computers and technology.
