ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Jahirul Alam Bhuyan. 

I am currently a final year student of Asia Pacific University, Kuala Lumpur. My studies are on BSc. (Hons) in Computer Science. I have completed my O-Level and A-Level in India. 
I chose to take computer science because I love coding and developing applications. Currently I am working on my final year project, it's a web application, developed using 
Django framework. I am pretty new to web developement, its been fun and a pain in the butt.
