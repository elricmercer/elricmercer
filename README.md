ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Jahirul Alam Bhuyan, from Bangladesh 

I am currently a final year student of Asia Pacific University, Kuala Lumpur. My studies are on BSc. (Hons) in Computer Science. I've completed my O-Level and A-Level from India. 
I pursued a degree in Computer Science because I love coding, developing applications and things related to computers and technology. Currently I am working on my final year project, it's a web application, developed using Django framework. I am pretty new to web developement, its been fun and painfull
